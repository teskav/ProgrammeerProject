## Introduction & purpose
### Should the government of a country in Europe spend more money on health?
Some countries in Europe spend more money on health than other countries. Besides that, some countries make health insurance compulsory for their citizens, while other countries don't. But how much do the health spendings effect the health status of a country? The visualizations at this website should help the government of European countries to see if they should spend more money on health. And if so, where they can cut down the money from and on which specific health statistic they should spend more money.
