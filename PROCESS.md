## Day 1 (03-06-2019)
Finished the first draft of my proposal.

## Day 2 (04-06-2019)
Finished the first draft of my design document.
Started making my prototype. Created a homepage, a page for my visualizations and a page for some explanation. I added a navigation bar so you can easily switch between the different pages. I choose to make different pages to get a clear overview instead of all the information at one page.
