## Day 1 (03-06-2019)
Finished the first draft of my proposal. I chose to make the relationship between the health spendings and health statistic variables as the "head" visualization in stead of the map of Europe, since this relationship is more important to answer my question. The map shows more specific details.

## Day 2 (04-06-2019)
Finished my design document. I updated it after the meeting with my group and assistant. I added some extra interactive elements between the different visualizations, since this was not enough. We also came up with some extra optional elements to add if I have enough time.

Also started making my prototype of the website. Created a homepage, a page for my visualizations and a page for some explanation. I added a navigation bar so you can easily switch between the different pages. I chose to make different pages to get a clear overview instead of all the information at one page. This will give more clearity.
